# vue-basics
The purpose of this repository is to contain the boilerplate code for any Vue project that I create. A secondary goal of this repo is to go through some of the basic steps to working on your own Vue projects. This is by no means a professional tutorial but a place to show the process I went through when starting to learn Vue. Theres tons of ways to do this, but heres what I do currently :D
# Quick Introduction to Vue
Vue is a framework for creating front end web applications. The basic premise of vue is that you write components (re-useable blocks of html, css and javascipt) that make up your web page.
Vue is a big framework that has a generally low level to entry. I would have a read through the Vue documentation from the getting started page: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/
That is how I started, so it would be what I recommend. In my opinion web development in general has a steep learning curve, so its natural to be frustrated but keep going with it and you'll be fine.
# Creating a Vue Application
I have not been working in Vue for too long so I generally stick with using the vue cli to create Vue apps. There is a good tutorial on how to get that up and running here: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create 
There are other ways of creating Vue projects as well as a number of frameworks that make it easier to write vue code for different situations. For example:

- Gridsome: https://gridsome.org/
- Nuxt: https://nuxtjs.org/
